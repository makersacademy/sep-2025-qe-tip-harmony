## Giga - Project Details

This document provides some background to the Giga project.

Our company has been tasked with building a website for a company called Giga
who have a business model where they are able to sell tickets to music
events/gigs "for free".

Our company has no involvement in how those free tickets are sourced. We also do
not have access to the customer data, in terms of which gigs, bands, dates, etc.
these will be for and so we'll have to develop without knowing what the real
data will be - the customer is aware of this.

We are to provide a usable and functional site, according to their requirements
(defined via user stories), in only a few days' time. We're aware that it's a
short timescale, but the contract is valuable enough that we aim to deliver in
that time, for the customer - Giga - to assess, deploy and use. Both we and the
customer also accept that further work may be required, after the initial
release - if everything goes well.

User stories from the customer have been made available, as to has the
internally developed functional specification from which our engineering team
will work.
